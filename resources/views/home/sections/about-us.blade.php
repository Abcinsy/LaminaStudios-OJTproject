                        Lamina Studios was founded in January 2016 when the development of Dungeon Souls was in transition of
                        October 2015. The studio continued the development of the said game led by April Gianan as Game
                        Producer. April teamed up with Diogo Braga and became the Lead Game Developer of Dungeon Souls. During
                        the transition, the team collaborated with Igor Grincu (as Pixel Artist) and with many other

                        Lamina Studios' logo was designed by Paul Benedict Galvez, a De La Salle University Digital and
                        Multimedia Arts student from the Philippines. The logo represents the creative and innovative team
                        behind every project. Each member of the team demonstrates unique skill and talent which contributes
                        immensely in fulfilling our project goals. The collaborative efforts of the team members result to a
                        more productive and successful projects.
